Group project, that I completed while I was in The Netherlands for an 
Erasmus semester at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.

The problem we want to solve with this project, is the congestions at certain points on a 
train station during peak hours. Due to this, walking through, getting on and of the trains 
will take longer. Reducing this could lead to increased efficiency of train station and fewer 
trains getting missed by passengers.
We want to solve this by directing the passengers to go in the right direction of less crowded 
wagons which should evenly spread passengers across all wagons and across the whole 
platform instead of having them condensed at a specific point.
